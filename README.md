#  Digital Morie 3D Reconstruction

For this project, I do not intend to design a industrially working software for digial morie methods. But I want to experiment different phase dectection algorithms in this project. In other words, it is a research rather than an engneering project.
Intended Plan:
- [ ] generating fringe pattern
- [ ] stimulate the projection in 3Ds Max
- [ ] experiment different phase detection algorithms
- [ ] Write APIs for future use

## Getting Started
Before you fork, or just clone this project, I do not bear any obligation to make this project compatible with your machine. I experiment the whole project on a Windows10 Thinkpad Labtop.

### Prerequisites
For regular implementation, I use

```
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
```
For neural network implementation, I use
```
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
```
You can find terrific tutorials on this amazing environment just by googling.
